### 1. Random Giving Money Simulation<br />

Imagine a room full of 100 people with 100 dollars each. With every tick of the clock, every person with money gives a dollar to one randomly chosen other person. After some time progresses, how will the money be distributed? <br />
<br />
If on quick reflection you thought “more or less equally”, you are not alone. I asked 5 super-smart PhDs this question and they all had the same initial intuition. <br />

Inequality can arise from seemingly innocuous policies — you need to keep an eye on it.

Before sorting the outcomes, the simulated distribution of money is shown as below:<br />

After applying the sorting, the simulated distribution can be seen more clearly: <br />
